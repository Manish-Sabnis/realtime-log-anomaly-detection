# Logs & Anomaly Dashboard

This module provides an internal dashboard for observing system behavior
and analyzing logs generated by backend microservices.

It acts as the primary interface for viewing log data and ML-based
anomaly detection results.

---

## Scope

- Display logs from all backend services
- Visualize anomaly predictions and confidence scores
- Support filtering and analysis by service, status, and time
- Aid debugging, monitoring, and evaluation

---

## Architecture

The dashboard consumes data exposed by backend REST APIs that aggregate:

- Raw service logs
- ML inference responses linked to each log

This application is read-only and does not modify system state.

---

## Anomaly Injection (Testing and Evaluation)

Anomaly injection is an internal testing mechanism, not exposed to end
users through the SaaS application, and is used to validate the behavior
of the anomaly detection model under abnormal conditions.


### Types of Anomalies

- Error rate spikes  
- Failure bursts  
- Latency spikes  
- Service-specific failures (e.g., payment or authentication issues)

### Purpose

Injected anomalies help evaluate:
- Detection accuracy
- Model sensitivity
- False positives and false negatives
